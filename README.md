## Model and controller creation

You can generate a model and controller with the following commands:

node op make:controller something
```

The name after the model and controller statements must be given in the singular. Controller generation automatically appends the "Controller" suffix.

```

The command will prompt for the password.

The next command generates the default config file:

```bash

The database can be seeded with the following command:

```bash
node op db:seed <model_name> <file_path>
```

The model name must be given in the singular and lowercase. The file extension must be:

* .json
* .csv

The keys in the JSON file and the field names in the CSV file must match the model fields.

If the CSV file contains quotation marks, they are automatically removed.
